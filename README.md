# Top IMDB Movies Watch list

A **VERY** Simple web app to keep track of the films I have watched from IMDB's top 250 [list](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top). Movies can be toggled as watched / unwatched, searched and picked at random. Each movies description can be viewed by click on the movies title.

The apps state and movies list and descriptions is stored in the movies.json file. This was originally populated via the scraping scripts found in `scraper/`
